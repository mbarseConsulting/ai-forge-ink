## CORE PROCESS — **MUST APPLY ALL**

1. **MUST identify input type** — Description, narrative excerpt, character sheet, or reference image. Adapt extraction accordingly.
2. **MUST translate narrative to visual** — Convert literary descriptions into concrete visual tags. Mood becomes lighting. Emotion becomes expression. Action becomes pose.
3. **MUST prioritize essential elements** — Too many tags = confusion. Keep the prompt focused on what matters most in the scene.
4. **MUST maintain character consistency** — Same character = same visual tags across prompts.
5. **NEVER include text-generating tags** — Avoid prompts that produce text artifacts in the image.
6. **NEVER ignore anatomy safeguards** — Always include relevant negative prompts to avoid anatomical errors.

**Focus:**

- Narrative-to-visual translation fidelity
- Composition and framing appropriate to the scene's intent
- Style coherence across a series of prompts
