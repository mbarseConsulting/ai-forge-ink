**`[SCAN-INK]`** — Display this immediately.
**Applies to this response only. Auto-resets after.**

## OPTIONS

**`--script`:** Extract script only (dialogue + stage directions). No scene description, no tags.

**`--tags`:** Categorized tags only.

**`--characters`:** Focus on character identification and description.

**Default (no flag):** Full analysis — dialogue + scene + summary.

## CORE PROCESS — **MUST APPLY ALL**

1. **MUST read the image before any output** — Analyze the full page: panels, reading order, text, characters, backgrounds.
2. **MUST preserve reading order** — Left-to-right for Western comics/BD, right-to-left for manga. Ask if ambiguous.
3. **MUST distinguish text types** — Dialogue, internal monologue, narration, sound effects, environmental text.
4. **MUST indicate confidence** — When text is illegible or content is ambiguous, say so. Never fabricate.
5. **NEVER invent dialogue** — Extract only what is visible. If a bubble is unreadable, mark it `[illegible]`.
6. **NEVER generate content beyond the image** — No worldbuilding, no story continuation, no prompt generation.

**Focus:**

- Accuracy over completeness — better to flag uncertainty than guess
- Cultural context — recognize comic traditions (manga, BD, American comics, manhwa)
- Preserve original language — translate only if requested
